# Analyzing Mobile Game Data Using Pandas

### Project Goals

The main goals of my project are to demonstrate the skills I have gained throughout the Python course as a part of Professional Diploma in Data Analytics and Finnish Language from Aalto EE. I selected this project from a [collection of test assignments for data analytics](https://pavelbukhtik.notion.site/Product-Analyst-Data-Analyst-a5f7bea5a0064960bbdb7a3ee1e46e7) (NB: It's in Russian). The country codes and names data were sourced from the [ISO-3166 dataset](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/tree/master/all).

### Data Analysis Task

The task is to analyze mobile game data, which includes information about players such as their level, country, platform, registration date, and last login date. This analysis is expected to provide insight into the game's audience and player behavior.

### Questions

1) For each platform, determine the top 5 countries by the number of players.
2) What is the maximum lifetime of players in the game?
3) How many players are above level 20?
4) Calculate the average player level for each country.

### Dataset Description

Dataset source: [Google Sheets Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bb0mBd9OGSdH08POkWgcYlK9a2YPQq1Dd2XyikUdeeI/edit#gid=1478114822).

The initial table contains the following columns:

* country - the player's country
* pl - the player's level
* plf - the platform
* reg - the player's registration date
* ts - the time of the player's last login to the game
* user - the player's ID
